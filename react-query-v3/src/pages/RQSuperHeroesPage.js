  /**
   * react query caches the data for 5 minutes using query key and function as the unique key.
   * when loading this component it checks if data is present in cache for this API.
   * if the data is present in cache, it is immediately returned without setting isLoading to true.
   * however, background refetch is triggered and on success the new data is updated in the UI.
   * when background refetch happens isFetching will be set to true but isLoading will bet set to false.
   * when refetch happens after cached data expires, both isLoading and isFetching will be set to true.
   * the cached data is garbage collected after the cache time expires.
   * cache only expires when component is unmounted.
   *
   * To check this go to Devtools -> Network and set Throttling to Slow 3G.
   * then switch between Traditional Super Heroes page and RQ Super Heroes page and check in React query dev tools.
   * switch to different tab or window and come back and check in React query dev tools.
   *
   * we can also configure stale time which turns cached data state from fresh to stale after the time expires.
   * refetch will happen if cache has expired even when stale time has not expired.
   *
   * polling for data at regular intervals, it is not dependent on refetch on mount or refetch on window focus
   *
   * we can pass onSuccess, onError callbacks if we want to run side effects after fetching data.
   * on API failure, it retries 3 times. if failed all 3 attempts, then it call onError callback.
   *
   * To check error scenario change the url and refresh the page or click on the button.

   * SUMMARY
   * =======
   *
   * enabled prevents fetching on mount. it can be used to fetch on event like click of a button.
   *
   * cache depends on unmount. if cache is present, loading = false, fetching = true.
   * cache deals with loading screen.
   *
   * staleness is dependent on cache. if not stale, loading = false, fetching = false.
   * if cache expires, it is considered stale. if cache expired, loading = true, fetching = true.
   * staleness deals with refetching.
   *
   * refetch on mount when false is not dependent on staleness but it is dependent on cache.
   *
   * refetch on window focus when false is not dependent on staleness or cache.
   *
   * refetch interval is paused when switching tabs/windows.
   *
   * refetch interal in background will poll even when switching tabs/windows.
